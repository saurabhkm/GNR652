# Keras

Keras offers a high level deep learning API to build deep neural networks. It is the easiest to use out of all the DL frameworks we shall discuss here and has simply runs out of the box. There are many ready to use tools for data loading, and preprocessing. Keras is high level wrapper with its backend being two other popular DL frameworks, Tensorflow and Theano, but does not involve any of the complications of these frameworks.
