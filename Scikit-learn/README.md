# Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn also known as sklearn is one of the oldest of machine learning python libraries out there and has been in development since June 2007. It is a general purpose machine learning framework with tools for almost every operation needed in a typical machine learning workflow. From methods for data preprocessing and loading to various techniques for regression, classification and clustering techniques beautifully fitting into one straightforward flow. 


One can build neural network in scikit-learn if we wish to but it is not the most optimized framework for deep neural network implementation. Since the mainstream deep learning specific frameworks have got traction, developers build have shifted to them instead of sklearn. Nevertheless it is certainly good to know about it as it is a swissknife for any kind ML development. Let us have a look at how to write our own neural network in sklearn.
