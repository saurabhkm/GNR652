# Caffe
CAFFE(Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) is one of the older frameworks and also one of the fastest out there(atleast when I used it in early 2016). It is developed by the Berkeley Vision Group with the first release coming out in December 2013. Caffe has a very different development style than the other frameworks we will discuss here.
