# PyTorch
PyTorch is the most pythonic of all the DL frameworks discussed here. So If you're are a Python user you'll find it most intuitive and simple to develop with. PyTorch is also termed by a lot of people as one of the most modular frameworks out there. So let us begin with some fundamentals of how to get started with PyTorch before we write our very own deep network network in it.
